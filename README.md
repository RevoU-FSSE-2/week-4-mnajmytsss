<h2>Assignment Information</h2>

<ol>
<li>I reworked my last week assignment to make it looks more modern with similar concept of warframe website as reference.</li>
<li>Google font is used in this project, with Oswald.</li>
<li>Text shadow are applied for text on top of images to make it more clearer.</li>
<li>News section are made using Asymmetrical Grid</li>
<li>Day and Night mode is made by hiding checkbox and adding bunch of transition magic to make it FEEL like sliding buttons.</li>
<li>
Carousel is added at the bottom of News section, purely from css. I beg thee not to explain it in-depth because I made it at the dawn of night half-asleep.</li>
<li>Media query are optimized for 1440px, with small adjustment at 1024px and 768px. !important is used for screen above 600px to fix Mobile's burger menu sometimes hides navbar when transitioned to larger screen size.</li>
